    - Pipe
        Data transformation logic for presentation

    - Service

State Type
    UI state
        Assists in the presentation aspects of the application
        This might NOT be needed in other parts of application
        It is ok to maintain this in the component

    Application State
        Assists in the domain logic of the application
        It is highly likely that this data is needed in other parts of the application
        DO NOT maintain this in the component
